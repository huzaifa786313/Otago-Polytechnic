							<h3>Week 1 17 — 23 February, 2020</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="card-body">
							<h4>Monday</h4>
							<p>This was the first project class of the semester where i got to see all the teams and the
								projects for those teams avaliable, i made my choice on the security and operations
								project team led by Faisal Hasan which was ideal because i've had classes with him in
								the past i.e. Linux in year 2 semester 2</p>
							<p>This class was when we initial setup our machines and choose where we were going to sit
								although this spot might not be final untill thursday when we find out in the second
								project class of the week if we actually got into the project teams that we wanted</p>
							<h4>Tuesday</h4>
							<p></p>
							<h4>Wednesday</h4>
							<p></p>
							<h4>Thursday</h4>
							<p>I successfully got placed into the Operations and Security group and was given one of the
								Raspberry Pi clusters to work with, the objective of the raspberry pi cluster was to
								simulate a small office enviroment so they would require various services such as a mail
								server or a website. After the raspberry pi's were all set up we were to attack and
								defend against the other Raspberry Pi team so in order to achieve this i decided to
								install download and flash kali linux onto all of the raspberry pi SD cards but after i
								did this i realised i was off the mark and that they should be command line based and
								not GUI's so with that knowledge and some assisstance from James i instead downloaded
								and installed Raspbian Buster Lite which is a command line based linux system</p>
							<h4>Friday</h4>
							<p>After setting up Raspbian on all 3 of the raspberry pi's in my teams cluster i then had
								to figure out how to connect to them remotely in order to configure them, after doing
								some googling on this subject i learnt that you needed to create a file and rename it
								ssh on the sd card this then enables ssh on the raspberry pi allowing for remote
								connection all that was left now was to figure out what the ip address of the raspberry
								pi's were. </p>
							<p>After googling to find out what the ip address was of a connected raspberry pi i came
								accross a stackoverflow post that answered this question and it was to run the following
								command seen in the picture below <img src="img/raspberryip.JPG" width=100%>
							</p>
							<p>I proceeded to turn the devices and discover there ip one at a time in order to not get
								confused with which device in the cluster stack had which ip, once i had all of
								the ip addresses for the raspberry pi devices i then connected to each of them through
								ssh and setup basic configuration of the devices such as changing the hosts and hostname
								of the devices </p>

							<p>
								I began to test Msmtp/mutt in order to email logs from /var/log/ to an email address for the purpose to notify if anything unusal was happening but to begin with a i just sent the syslogs
							</p>
							<h4>Thursday</h4>
							<p>
								After sucsess with manually sending logs i decided to create a cron hourly job and see if that would work to send email logs every hour, i did this for about 2 days before i decided to stop it for the moment as nothing important was happening and i would reconfigure it and implement it back later on when the attack and defending scenarios were happening
							</p>
							<h4>Friday</h4>
							<p>I began looking into helping the farmbot team as they were unable to connect to their
								farmbot device unless they were using mobile data which wasn't a plausable option for
								them
								<br><br>
								My initial thought was that I could setup a private network inside the polytech using a
								raspberry pi to create a wireless access point and hope that would allow the bypassing
								of the polytech policies.
								<br><br>
								I used the following 2 guides to quickly set it up
							<ul>
								<li>
									<a
										href="https://howtoraspberrypi.com/create-a-wi-fi-hotspot-in-less-than-10-minutes-with-pi-raspberry/">https://howtoraspberrypi.com/create-a-wi-fi-hotspot-in-less-than-10-minutes-with-pi-raspberry/</a>
								</li>
								<li>
									<a
										href="https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui">https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui</a>
								</li>
							</ul>
							
							I then needed to enable forwarding of packets by uncommenting #net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 in
							/etc/sysctl.conf this then allowed users to connect to the raspberry pi wireless network and
							access the internet through it, at this point I believed that this would work to get Farmbot
							to work.
							<br><br>
							After getting everything setup i then proceeded to re-flash the farmbot os onto the raspberry pi device that was going to be used for farmbot i then connected this device to farmbot hardware and turned it on, i then connected to the farmbots device initial setup Wi-Fi where i then choose for its connection to the internet to be that of the raspberry pi's private network that i had setup after this was done i then connected to the private network on the mobile device and went to the farmbot web url https://my./farm.bot/ which allowed me to access the web interface for the farmbot device, in theory this should of allowed me to use the controls to move the farmbot hardware but atlast it did not so i had to come up with a new plan on how to get connection between farmbot and the mobile device.
							<br><br>
							later on that day i had an idea that i could try to setup a vpn that would allow me to bypass the polytechs policies that were blocking connections, i took this idea to Rob to see if it would be ok or if it would cause some issues and if it could possibly work, he said it should be ok since we were third year students and were doing it for a non-malicious purpose and also confirmed that it might be a possible solution

							<h4>Wednesday</h4>
							<p>Farmbot is now successfully working
								After all my previous attempts to get Farmbot running I went back to the FarmBot2020
								GitHub repo https://github.com/Lockam1/FarmBot2020 and investigated the network
								documentation that was from previous semesters.
								<br><br>
								After looking at WirelessConnection-MAY19.pdf I saw that Rob had requested a key from
								ITS for the MAC address associated with the Farmbot device and they then mention that it
								is on the OP-Mobile network, after seeing this I then went over the other files and saw
								in ConnectionIssues-OCT19.pdf that there was a mention of checking if it will work
								eduroam network. In the document 2019LAN-WiFi%20connection-Pre-Showcase.pdf they
								mentioned that they but the MAC address of the Farmbot device on wireless vlan 35 which
								doesn't have any port restrictions.
								<br><br>
								So after reading all this I went to check with Rob if maybe the reason it didn’t work
								was because the device the students were using was not also in the same network / vlan
								as the Farmbot device I also asked if the previous Farmbot group had tried this solution
								which he was unsure of. I also checked in with Vaughn to update him on the plan as well
								as asked him about if he knew if the previous group had attempted something similar to
								which he was unsure of (this gave me some hope that it was going to work).
								<br><br>
								I then proceeded to take myself and Damian over to ITS to get his device placed on vlan
								35 in the OP-Mobile network, but Perrin was unavailable so instead I sent an email to
								him. While I was waiting for a response I flashed the SD with a fresh install of Farmbot
								and was going to place the key onto the Farmbot device so it would be set to go as soon
								as we heard back from Perrin with the key for Damian's device, when I was about to set
								the Wi-Fi to "OP-Mobile" I noticed that it didn’t have a key icon next to it and went to
								talk to rob about this, I then had the idea of manually setting the network to
								"OP-Mobile" this then asked me to input the key which I did.
								<br><br>
								For some reason I then thought maybe 50/50 this might work so I connected my mobile
								phone to the eduroam network and went to my.farm.bot which then proceeded to work but in
								order to actually confirm that I could move Farmbot from the app I then had to plug it
								in with the help of James Wood, we pressed the arrows on the web app and BAM it worked
								but in order to see if it was actually working and not a fluke we got James to connect
								to Farmbot on his device and see if he could also operate it which he could.
								<br><br>
								The answer was in the documentation all along, but it was spread out over different docs
								we will now condense the solution in order to make future groups life a bit easier.

							<h4>Thursday</h4>
							<p>I managed to successfully reboot the previous used ticketing system for the Operations
								and Security team i also added myself as an admin for the ticketing system via the
								command line this allowed me to disable the previous semesters accounts so they couldn't
								see our current tickets this was done purely as a security measure, i also create
								accounts for the current team and upgrade the previous semester members that were now in
								project 2 to admin accounts this allows everyone to work with the ticketing system, I
								then informed Faisal on the progress of the ticketing system.</p>
							<p>When i arrived home i then informed Matthew Hall who was the lead on working with the
								ticketing system and was looking at possible new applications to serve this function
								that i managed to reboot the previous ticketing system that was in place <img
									src="img/ticketing1.JPG" width=100%></p>
							<p>After getting the ticketing system back up and running i noticed that there was a large
								amount of tickets still remaining from the previous semester further investigation into
								these tickets saw that they were being automaticaly generate based on the nagios server
								checks and we were recieving a large amount of spam</p>

							<p>In the Operations and Security meeting i updated the group on the progress of Farmbot
								which was not officaly up and running and that a report will be compiled with the
								process of figuring out the solution and the support documents that were used, Matthew
								also informed the group about the progress i had made with the ticketing system and that
								we would instead use that instead of a new application as it was already working and
								other applications would of required time investment</p>

							<h4>Monday</h4>
							<p>Kane and I decided to come in on Otago Aniversery team in order to implement bridging
								through the linux machine provided, our bridge was built using reference material from
								last semesters linux labs where we had to create a network bridge for one of our labs, I
								managed to get the bridge setup and working on my system but unfortunatley Kane's wasnt
								working, this turned out to be caused by an a conflict with iptables so we removed that
								so his bridge could work correctly.

								After we got the bridge working for both machines we rebooted all the machines and for a
								reason we didn't discover at the time it broke the bridge we had created, so we quickly
								got the bridge back up and finished for the day.
							</p>
							<h4>Tuesday</h4>
							<p>After recieving an email from polytech informing us that the building will be locked due
								to covid-19 at 5pm i talked with Kane and we decided to revert the bridge change and
								continue with the previous way we were working so that we could successfully connect and
								reset the devices from home this allowed us to work on the raspberry pi project from
								home without worrying about breaking the raspberry pi's</p>

							<p>I took what i learnt in System's Administration and added both owncloud and nagios to the raspberry pi's in order to help reinforce familiarity with installation and configuration of these softwares, i also created a slack channel for the raspberry pi project that i could use to test if nagios would correctly be able to send messages of errors in the configured nagios checks, after i got nagios and slack both ready to go i then proceeded to create a nagios check that would test disk space on the raspberry pi devices and i set it so it would appear that they were full in order to force a notification to slack from nagios which worked as planned <img src="img/nagioscheck.JPG" width=100%> </p>

							<h4>Friday</h4>
							<p>Once again farmbot is working correctly from both the mobile and laptop device, I'm not 100% sure on what was the cause of their problems as i followed the instructions from the print out that i gave them when i first got it working but it may of been because i used WPA instead of WPA2. I may repeat this process a few more times next week to just confirm it the problem was WPA instead of WPA2.</p>
