                            <h4>Monday</h4>
                            <p>This was the first project class of the semester where i got to see all the teams and the
                                projects for those teams avaliable, i made my choice on the security and operations
                                project team led by Faisal Hasan which was ideal because i've had classes with him in
                                the past i.e. Linux in year 2 semester 2</p>
                            <p>This class was when we initial setup our machines and choose where we were going to sit
                                although this spot might not be final untill thursday when we find out in the second
                                project class of the week if we actually got into the project teams that we wanted.
                            </p>
                            <p>We were also tasked with filling out a computer health and safety moodle module and fill
                                out an after-hours access allowing for our ID cards to get into the project room, i
                                printed out and filled in the after-hours access form and returned it to Rob and then
                                was going to start the health and safety module but access was restricted so no one in
                                the class could do it at the time</p>
                            <h4>Tuesday</h4>
                            <p>No project work was achieved as i had yet to be informed of what project group i was assigned to.</p>
                            <h4>Wednesday</h4>
                            <p>The health and safety moodle module was finaly unrestritced so i was able to get onto it
                                and complete it before the next scheduled project class <img src="img/prereq.JPG"
                                    width=100%></p>
                            <h4>Thursday</h4>
                            <p>I successfully got placed into the Operations and Security group and was given one of the
                                Raspberry Pi clusters to work with, the objective of the raspberry pi cluster was to
                                simulate a small office enviroment so they would require various services such as a mail
                                server or a website. After the raspberry pi's were all set up, we were to attack and
                                defend against the other Raspberry Pi team so in order to achieve this i decided to
                                install download and flash kali linux onto all of the raspberry pi SD cards but after i
                                did this i realised i was off the mark and that they should be command line based and
                                not GUI's so with that knowledge and some assisstance from James i instead downloaded
                                and installed Raspbian Buster Lite which is a command line based linux system</p>
                            <h4>Friday</h4>
                            <p>After setting up Raspbian on all 3 of the raspberry pi's in my team’s cluster I then had
                                to figure out how to connect to them remotely in order to configure them, after doing
                                some googling on this subject i learnt that you needed to create a file and rename it
                                ssh on the sd card this then enables ssh on the raspberry pi allowing for remote
                                connection all that was left now was to figure out what the ip address of the raspberry
                                pi's were. </p>
                            <p>After googling to find out what the ip address was of a connected raspberry pi i came
                                accross a stackoverflow post that answered this question and it was to run the following
                                command seen in the picture below <img src="img/raspberryip.JPG" width=100%>
                            </p>
                            <p>I proceeded to turn the devices on and discover there ip one at a time in order to not
                                get
                                confused with which device in the cluster stack had which ip, once i had all of
                                the ip addresses for the raspberry pi devices i then connected to each of them through
                                ssh and setup basic configuration of the devices such as changing the hosts and hostname
                                of the devices. </p>

                            <p>After bricking the raspberry pi's numerous times and having to reflash Raspbian back onto
                                the SD cards i decided to start working with bash scripts for each server so that way if
                                i broke it and had to reset it i could easily revert it back to the point before i broke
                                it, it also had the added benefit of being able to make sure that all of the machines
                                were configured similar </p>

                            <p>Kane and I decided to create a git repository for the raspberry pi project so that we
                                could upload our scripts, guides and other various related information <img src="img/gitupload.JPG" width=100%><br>Here is a link to the github repository <a href="https://github.com/dunnkh1/Raspberry_Office_Network">https://github.com/dunnkh1/Raspberry_Office_Network</a></p>

                            <p>After recieving my research topic assessment from Michael for IN723 Advanced Networks one of the avaliable topics was network automation i decided to research Ansible a network automation tool and my end goal was to figure out how to implement this onto the raspberry pi's, after i have completed my research assignment i will attach a copy of it to this portfolio as it will serve as the basis of how i figure out to get ansible working on a raspberry pi network<br>I started to create more specific scripts for the installation and setup of specific services and configuration such as one that was dedicated to setting up a basic apache2 web server<img src="img/webserver.JPG" width=100%></p>

                            <p>I had heard from Damian in Vaughn's robotics project that they may require some
                                assisstance in getting farmbot up and running
                                <img src="img/farmbot1.JPG" width=100%>
                                <br>
                                After my mornings System's Administration class on using puppet to help automate tasks and setup and such, i began thinking more about using ansible.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Tuesday</h4>
                            <p>Now that the raspberry pi's are on a private network i needed to confirm that i could
                                still git push and pull from the private ip devices which thankfully i could</p>
                            <h4>Wednesday</h4>
                            <p>
                                I began to test Msmtp/mutt in order to email logs from /var/log/ to an email address for
                                the purpose to notify if anything unusal was happening but to begin with a i just sent
                                the syslog’s
                            </p>
                            <h4>Thursday</h4>
                            <p>
                                After sucsess with manually sending logs i decided to create a cron hourly job and see
                                if that would work to send email logs every hour, i did this for about 2 days before i
                                decided to stop it for the moment as nothing important was happening and i would
                                reconfigure it and implement it back later on when the attack and defending scenarios
                                were happening
                            </p>
                            <h4>Friday</h4>
                            <p>I began looking into helping the farmbot team as they were unable to connect to there farmbot device unless they were using mobile data which wasn't a plausable option for
                                them
                                <br><br>
                                My initial thought was that I could setup a private network inside the polytech using a
                                raspberry pi to create a wireless access point and hope that would allow the bypassing
                                of the polytech policies.
                                <br><br>
                                I used the following 2 guides to quickly set it up
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <a
                                        href="https://howtoraspberrypi.com/create-a-wi-fi-hotspot-in-less-than-10-minutes-with-pi-raspberry/">https://howtoraspberrypi.com/create-a-wi-fi-hotspot-in-less-than-10-minutes-with-pi-raspberry/</a>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <a
                                        href="https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui">https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui</a>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            I then needed to enable forwarding of packets by uncommenting #net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 in
                            /etc/sysctl.conf this then allowed users to connect to the raspberry pi wireless network and
                            access the internet through it, at this point I believed that this would work to get Farmbot
                            to work.
                            <br><br>
                            After getting everything setup i then proceeded to re-flash the farmbot os onto the
                            raspberry pi device that was going to be used for farmbot i then connected this device to
                            farmbot hardware and turned it on, i then connected to the farmbots device initial setup
                            Wi-Fi where i then choose for its connection to the internet to be that of the raspberry
                            pi's private network that i had setup after this was done i then connected to the private
                            network on the mobile device and went to the farmbot web url <a
                                href="https://my.farm.bot/">https://my.farm.bot/</a> which allowed me to access the web
                            interface for the farmbot device, in theory this should have allowed me to use the controls to
                            move the farmbot hardware but atlast it did not so i had to come up with a new plan on how
                            to get connection between farmbot and the mobile device.
                            <br><br>
                            later on, that day i had an idea that i could try to setup a vpn that would allow me to
                            bypass the polytechs policies that were blocking connections, i took this idea to Rob to see
                            if it would be ok or if it would cause some issues and if it could possibly work, he said it
                            should be ok since we were third year students and were doing it for a non-malicious purpose
                            and also confirmed that it might be a possible solution

                            <p>Farmbot is now successfully working
                                After all my previous attempts to get Farmbot running I went back to the FarmBot2020
                                GitHub repo <a
                                    href="https://github.com/Lockam1/FarmBot2020">https://github.com/Lockam1/FarmBot2020</a>
                                and investigated the network
                                documentation that was from previous semesters.
                                <br><br>
                                After looking at WirelessConnection-MAY19.pdf I saw that Rob had requested a key from
                                ITS for the MAC address associated with the Farmbot device and they then mention that it
                                is on the OP-Mobile network, after seeing this I then went over the other files and saw
                                in ConnectionIssues-OCT19.pdf that there was a mention of checking if it will work
                                eduroam network. In the document 2019LAN-WiFi%20connection-Pre-Showcase.pdf they
                                mentioned that they but the MAC address of the Farmbot device on wireless vlan 35 which
                                doesn't have any port restrictions.
                                <br><br>
                                So, after reading all this I went to check with Rob if maybe the reason it didn’t work
                                was because the device the students were using was not also in the same network / vlan
                                as the Farmbot device I also asked if the previous Farmbot group had tried this solution
                                which he was unsure of. I also checked in with Vaughn to update him on the plan as well
                                as asked him about if he knew if the previous group had attempted something similar to
                                which he was unsure of (this gave me some hope that it was going to work).
                                <br><br>
                                I then proceeded to take myself and Damian over to ITS to get his device placed on vlan
                                35 in the OP-Mobile network, but Perrin was unavailable so instead I sent an email to
                                him. While I was waiting for a response, I flashed the SD with a fresh install of Farmbot
                                and was going to place the key onto the Farmbot device so it would be set to go as soon
                                as we heard back from Perrin with the key for Damian's device, when I was about to set
                                the Wi-Fi to "OP-Mobile" I noticed that it didn’t have a key icon next to it and went to
                                talk to rob about this, I then had the idea of manually setting the network to
                                "OP-Mobile" this then asked me to input the key which I did.
                                <br><br>
                                For some reason I then thought maybe 50/50 this might work so I connected my mobile
                                phone to the eduroam network and went to my.farm.bot which then proceeded to work but in
                                order to actually confirm that I could move Farmbot from the app I then had to plug it
                                in with the help of James Wood, we pressed the arrows on the web app and BAM it worked
                                but in order to see if it was actually working and not a fluke, we got James to connect
                                to Farmbot on his device and see if he could also operate it which he could.
                                <br><br>
                                The answer was in the documentation all along, but it was spread out over different docs
                                we will now condense the solution in order to make future groups life a bit easier.

                            <p>I managed to successfully reboot the previous used ticketing system for the Operations
                                and Security team i also added myself as an admin for the ticketing system via the
                                command line this allowed me to disable the previous semesters accounts so they couldn't
                                see our current tickets this was done purely as a security measure, i also create
                                accounts for the current team and upgrade the previous semester members that were now in
                                project 2 to admin accounts this allows everyone to work with the ticketing system, I
                                then informed Faisal on the progress of the ticketing system.
                                <br> Before i left for the day i had to take the ticketing system offline due the
                                excessive spam it was outputing to both the email addresses of the admin accounts and to
                                the system itself. <img src="img/ticketingdown.JPG" width=100%></p>
                            <p>When i arrived home i then informed Matthew Hall who was the lead on working with the
                                ticketing system and was looking at possible new applications to serve this function
                                that i managed to reboot the previous ticketing system that was in place <img
                                    src="img/ticketing1.JPG" width=100%></p>
                            <p>After getting the ticketing system back up and running i noticed that there was a large
                                amount of tickets still remaining from the previous semester further investigation into
                                these tickets saw that they were being automaticaly generate based on the nagios server
                                checks and we were recieving a large amount of spam</p>

                                also informed the group about the progress i had made with the ticketing system and that
                                we would instead use that instead of a new application as it was already working and
                                other applications would have required time investment</p>

                            <p>Kane and I decided to come in on Otago Aniversery team in order to implement bridging
                                through the linux machine provided, our bridge was built using reference material from
                                last semesters linux labs where we had to create a network bridge for one of our labs, I
                                managed to get the bridge setup and working on my system but unfortunatley Kane's wasnt
                                working, this turned out to be caused by a conflict with iptables, so we removed that
                                so, his bridge could work correctly.

                                After we got the bridge working for both machines, we rebooted all the machines and for a
                                reason we didn't discover at the time it broke the bridge we had created, so we quickly
                                got the bridge back up and finished for the day.

                                continue with the previous way we were working so that we could successfully connect and
                                reset the devices from home this allowed us to work on the raspberry pi project from

                            <p>I took what i learnt in System's Administration and added both owncloud and nagios to the
                                raspberry pi's in order to help reinforce familiarity with installation and
                                configuration of these softwares. <img src="img/owncloudnagios.JPG" width=100%>
                                My next plan was to find a way to get nagios to send alert message to the Operations and
                                Security team channel and i learnt that it's kind of difficult, i needed to create a
                                webhook that could be used to connect nagios and teams together which was easy enough to
                                setup. <img src="img/teamscheck.JPG" width=100%>
                                But unfortunatley it was more complicated to actually implement it afterwards so instead
                                i then decided to create a slack channel for the raspberry pi project that i could use
                                to test if nagios would correctly be able to send messages of errors in the configured
                                nagios checks, after i got nagios and slack both ready to go i then proceeded to create
                                a nagios check that would test disk space on the raspberry pi devices and i set it so it
                                would appear that they were full in order to force a notification to slack from nagios
                                which worked as planned <img src="img/nagioscheck.JPG" width=100%> <br>
                                After it was all setup i did some further research and tried to find out if you can send
                                notifications from slack to Microsoft Teams, and it turns out you can, but they are paid
                                applications </p>

                            <p>I went into polytech to see what was the issue with the raspberry pi "zeus" connection so
                                because i couldn't ssh onto it i had to plug a mini hdmi cable and keyboard into the
                                device so i could connect and see what was happening that way, when i got it all
                                connected it turns out that the top raspberry pi which was meant to have the SD card
                                configured with the zeus configuration instead had the poseidon card in it, so i swapped
                                the cards over and rebooted them both and confirmed that it was all back up and running
                            </p>

                            <h4>Thursday</h4>
                            <p>I was trying to ssh onto the zeus raspberry pi from home but was getting connection
                                refused so i went onto my mgmt server for System's Administration and nmap'd the zeus ip
                                and discovered that the command nmap -p- 10.118.2.72 wasn't returning open ports so
                                instead i had to use nmap -Pn- 10.118.2.72 and discovered that it was being filtered
                                <img src="img/nmapfilter.JPG" width=100%> <br><br>So i contacted Damian to see if he was
                                on site at polytech for his robotics project and he was, so i asked him if he could
                                spare a moment and go over to the raspberry pi machines and connect to the top device on
                                the raspberry pi stack which was meant to be zeus but when he got onto it, it once again
                                was poseidon which led me to believe someone was messing with it, after this the zeus
                                raspberry pi began to have kernel panics and wouldn't restart correctly so i decided i
                                would come in the next day and once again fix it. </p>
                            <h4>Friday</h4>
                            <p>So i had to go back into polytech because the raspberry pi "zeus" was having kernel
                                issues so once again i had to connect an hdmi cable and keyboard to get onto it, after
                                googling how to fix it by checking the error code it was giving i then took the sd card
                                out of zeus and plugged it into the card reader connected to a linux machine that we had
                                setup to act as a bridge and began to modify files that should have fixed the problem
                                according to the answers i discovered when googling the error. After about an hour of
                                trying to fix it i had to give up and instead just reflashed a fresh Raspbian Lite image
                                onto it i then put the sd card into the raspberry pi and rebooted it. I then configured
                                port_forwarding and recreated the virtual interfaces on the device so that the other 2
                                raspberry pi's could still access the internet i then ran the scripts to get it initally
                                configured with the host names and user accounts although this time i removed the other
                                teams account from the creation script, i then confirmed that everything was working
                                correctly by logging onto both the other raspberry pi's and doing ping tests between
                                each other, the default gateway (zeus) and google (8.8.8.8) all of these came back with
                                a positive connection</p>

                            <p>After my weekend one on one meeting with Tom for System's Administration and our
                                discussion on the puppet owncloud module i decided that i would create a bash script
                                that would install and setup owncloud and its various required modules, i then took this
                                script and deployed it on zeus in order to get owncloud back up and running quickly,
                                after deploying this script owncloud is now working once again on zeus<img

                                connected directly to the polytech network or going through something like citrix</p>

                            <p>Today Faisal informed us that he had installed vulnerabilities on our raspberry pi
                                systems and that we needed to discover, exploit and then fix them. I was able to nmap scan my own devices in order to discover if any new ports had been opened <img src="img/vuln.JPG" width=100%><br>
                            On the device with the ip of 192.168.1.2 i noticed that port 53 as well as 8192 had been opened which leads me to believe these were the vulnerabilities that Faisal had deployed on our servers, now all that was left to do was to figure out how to fix what Faisal did.
                            <br>
                            I also knew the default login details for the other team's raspberry pi as they hadn't changed it so i logged onto their gateway server and nmap'd the gateway and there private ip devices to discover the vulnerable ports <img src="img/nmap.JPG" width=100%> <br> After looking at the nmap scan of the other team's devices and comparing it with my own i can see that both networks have a vulnerablitie on port 53 and they may also have one on port 44306 unless that is being used by something they installed.

                                being able to connect to farmbot to which they were so i messaged Damian later on in the
                                evening to let him know that when i go in tomorrow i'll look into it and see if i can
                                get is fixed</p>

                            <p>Once again farmbot is working correctly from both the mobile and laptop device, I'm not
                                100% sure on what was the cause of their problems as i followed the instructions from
                                the printout that i gave them when i first got it working but it may have been because I
                                used WPA instead of WPA2. I may repeat this process a few more times next week to just
                                confirm it the problem was WPA instead of WPA2.</p>
